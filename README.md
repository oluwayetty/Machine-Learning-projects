Fake news—news articles that are intentionally and verifiably false designed to manipulate people’s perceptions of reality—has been used to influence
politics and promote advertising. But it has also become a method to stir up and intensify social conflict.This project has combined two datasets to classify if a news is fake or true. In this folder, we have the code in jupter notebook, a report and powerpoint. This project was awarded the highest mark among 50 presentations.

## Second project is in the Second folder is on Malware Analysis

This project aims to propose a befitting function to classify android malicious software to protect sensitive data against malicious threats using data mining and machine learning classification
techniques. In this work, I employed a robust and efficient approach for malware classification by analyzing the data while exploring techniques to combat the imbalanced datasets. Simply put, a
binary classification to determine if an application is malware or not.

## Third project is in the Third folder is on Naive Bayes

A simple implementation of Naive bayes on spam emails classification

## Fourth project is in the Fourth folder is on Venice boat classification
![](https://github.com/oluwayetty/malware-analysis/blob/master/venice.jpg)

This project is focused on the detection and classification of Venice boats using Deep learning. Past related project used the following classification methods: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), a Decision Tree Learning Algorithm, and Random Forest (RF) from
the WEKA environment. In this project, I built a convolution neural network(CNN) that can detect Venice boats and identify its category while explaining the techniques used throughout the process. Datasets can be found [here](http://users.diag.uniroma1.it/bloisi/papers/bloisi-vrs2015-draft.pdf)
