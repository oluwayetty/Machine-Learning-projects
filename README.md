This project aims to propose a befitting function to classify android malicious software to protect sensitive data against malicious threats using data mining and machine learning classification
techniques. In this work, I employed a robust and efficient approach for malware classification by analyzing the data while exploring techniques to combat the imbalanced datasets. Simply put, a
binary classification to determine if an application is malware or not.

## Second project is in the second folder is on Naive Bayes

This project is focused on the detection and classification of Venice boats using Deep learning. Past related project used the following classification methods: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), a Decision Tree Learning Algorithm, and Random Forest (RF) from
the WEKA environment. In this project, I built a convolution neural network(CNN) that can detect Venice boats and identify its category while explaining
the techniques used throughout the process.
